# Caltrops-type secondary weapon. Variations deal different damage types.
# Ship launches a mine, mine has large trigger radius. When triggered, launches submunitions randomly towards
# the triggering target. Submunition launch pattern should approximate a circle around the target's current position
# Submunitions simultaneously expire into a 1-frame life explosive object with a blast radius such that, if
# launched in a circle, each blast radius would touch the center of the circle.
# Note: These outfits deal splash damage! you'll get hit too... but dang they nice :)
